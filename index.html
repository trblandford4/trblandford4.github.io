										<h3>Time Tracking Dashboard</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze the effectiveness of the Time Tracking simplification, and provide executive reporting that supports management decisions and drives process improvements.</p>
									<h5><em>Why does this matter?</em></h5>
									<p><strong>Time is the most scarce resource on Earth.</strong> The technology organization recognizes the less time spent on unneccessary processes, the more time we have to build high value products for our customers.The simplification eliminated about 80 percent of the labor hours tracked, so there's still plenty of room for improvement. The dashboard gives insight into where the continued tracking pain points are, and is being used to develop resolutions.</p>

									<p>Created a repeatable process for mapping the Application Technical Contacts (ATCs) in CAMR to their Technology or Business function.</p>
									<h5><em>Why does this matter?</em></h5>
									<p>Technology Services power everything we do at Visa. The Technology Service Catalog maps the relationship between the applications, infrastructures, and websites in CAMR<sup>1</sup> and their respective Technology Product Groups. The ATC Analysis gives key information as to who is managing applications and where; inside or outside technology. We are able to assess the impact to each stakeholder as a result of critical business decisions and develop key insights.</p>

										<h3>The Gatekeeper of Technology</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I was so lucky to be placed on one of the most unique teams at Visa. The perspective through the lens of Technology Business Management is so unique.TBMs function is to run the technology organization like a business. Making sure that processes are in place to maximize efficiency, and technology delivery is united with business management strategies.</p>
									<p>I can clearly see that my projects are in line with the company trend of making work easier. I've been fortunate enough to work cross-functionally with leaders in both tech and biz to accomplish this, and leverage these connections with TBMs bird's eye view to gain a holistic understanding of Visa. However, the most valuable product I've developed throughout the summer has been the relationships built with my teammates. I have truly felt like a real TBMer because of these incredible people.</p>

						<h2>An unforgettable summer</h2>
						<p>It's hard to call what I've done this summer <em>"work."</em> On May 23rd, I backed out of my driveway in Maryland, car full of snacks and luggage, with a smile that stretched coast to coast. 10 cities and about 4000 miles later, I arrived in beautiful Foster City, California, even more amped for my June 1st start date. Over the course of my 11 weeks here in Foster City, I truly have had the experience of a lifetime.</p>

									<h3>The Highlight Reel</h3>
									<p>Destination Everywhere, food trucks, and weekend adventures; this summer I've made memories with people from all every corner of the globe. From Executives to interns to all the crazy locals and everyone in between, the culture of Visa, and the Bay Area, is that of openness and innovation. Everyone is incredibly smart and dedicated, but still know how to let loose and have a little fun.</p>
									<p>Visa has made sure that I've taken advantage of all the things the Bay Area has to offer. San Francisco is an incredible place, and sadly 11 weeks just isn't enough. But I'm content in saying that I've made the most of every moment and learned more than I could have ever imagined.</p>

						<h2>"The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."</h2>
						<p>My childhood hero Dr. Suess has never been more right. Despite all the valuable things I've learned, my thirst for knowledge has only grown more insatiable this summer. My quest to learn and grow at Visa has taken me more places than any other journey has in my life to date.</p>

								<h3>Technology</h3>
								<p>I didn't learn technology in the traditional sense. Okay, I did study a little bit
									of programming this summer, how to make beautiful visualizations in Tableau,
									and how to wield Excel like a ninja to keep insanely large data sets in check.
									But I don't know if that's the most important thing I've learned about tech.</p>
								<p>Now is an incredible time to be alive for Technology. We're watching
									innovation like never before, and on a global scale. Our ability to collect data from
									everything is driving change at an Olympic pace. I've learned how a giant company like
									Visa breaks large org stereotypes and keeps up with, even ahead, of these 
									changes. Despite my initial interpretation, I found that Visa is much more than 
									just a "credit card company." In fact, being the premier payments company, we are leading
									the industry in digitizing payments. It's an incredible thing to witness.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<h3>Business</h3>
								<p>I study Business at Virginia Tech, but no classroom could teach me what TBM has — 
									Business as we know it is evolving. Business used to direct technology, but now tech
									has picked up the baton and is directing the show. Those that don't follow
									don't make it.</p>
								<p>That being said, Visa and TBM have showed me the importance of empowering this shift. My projects,
									and the general trend of the business, is shifting to streamline processes and make work
									easier and more enjoyable. We're becoming very analytical, finding pain points and addressing them.
									Overall, the business has focused on user experience — How do we do good
									work and pack as much value as possible into each delivery? Whether that be a Project Manager, an Engineer,
									a Merchant, or a Cardholder.<br><br>
									Also, I've learned <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryan-mcinerney/97/386/798">Ryan McInerney</a> is the coolest
									corporate President alive. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<h3>Management</h3>
								<p>Management is much more than just a function of Business. It comes into play with every facet of life.
								You manage time, money, relationships, and not knowing how to do so can be detrimental to your happiness.
								Visa clearly recognizes the importance, as one of the 6 strategic goals is to establish <em>Deep</em> Partnerships.
								Ultimately, everything we do is to enrich society, and make people's lives better. We wouldn't make money otherwise.
								Evolving to have meaningful interactions and mutual success is imperative to success, in business and in life.
								</p>
								<p>TBM has taught me this dynamic management style. We work with both Business and Technology stakeholders to ensure
								technology is operating as efficiently as possible. I've learned the importance of time management. Having to maintain
								momentum on multiple projects that are seemingly unrelated, while still meeting deliverables. Most importantly, it's
								important to connect with your team. Work is more enjoyable which drives better work ethic, and ultimately, happier
								customers. In the end, that's the most important thing.</p>

						<h2>Farewell for now, Foster City</h2>
						<p>When ~10,000 people are powering $7 Trillion USD <em>(yeah, that's trillion with a T!)</em> in transaction volume, it's undeniable that each employee has a monumental impact. I've never felt like an "intern" at Visa, just a member of the family. I'm heading back to Blacksburg to finish my last 2 years at Virginia Tech. I know wielding my newfound knowledge and experience from this summer with Visa, I can overcome any obstacle in life, and my next adventure isn't too far away.</p>
